    <h2><a href="./public/movie-ranking.html">Movie Ranking Project</a></h2>
    <p>First HTML project produced as part of my learning journey. Task was to list my favourite <br>
        movies utilising functionality I had recently learnt (Headers and Paragraphs)

    <h2><a href="./public/birthday-invite.html">Birthday Invite Project</a></h2>
    <p>Second HTML project creating a birthday invite website. This built upon previous knowledge<br>
    of utilising headers and paragraphs to embedding images and creating ordered and unordered <br>
    lists. In addition I utilised anchor elements to link to different sections within the webpage.</p>
