<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Hello You</h2>

<h3>MY NAME IS HARRY AND I AM AN ASPIRING WEB DEVELOPER</h3>

<p>Where to start.... A good place will be how I stumbled across the web development world. Educationally I didn't train to be a
  software engineer/web developer. My background was in Sports and Exercise Science and I stumbled across a career as a 
  Business Analyst fresh out of university with Mercedes Benz.
</p>

<p>Here is where my passion for technology took over. I became obsessed with supporting business needs in automating processses
  and product ideation/deliver. During my growth as a BA/Product Owner and had this scratch that needed 
  itching....Web Development/Software Engineering. 
</p>

<p>As I worked in IT, albeit on the product side rather than development, I kept being asked by friends who had their own
businesses whether I could support with a website build or with existing issues with their web platforms. My answer was always
"I can support with the analysis and understand what support you will need, but I cannot go end to end". This made 
me think... What if I could utilise my analytical skillset, and utilise this within web development. This is what became my new
obsession, to teach myself how to code so I could support friends and family a like. Skip a couple of years, and a few 
promotions within the product space, that desire to understand web development still burns deeply, this has lead to me finally 
taking the leap to become a fully fledged web developer.</p>
